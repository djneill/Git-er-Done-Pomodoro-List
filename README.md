<h2 align="center">Goals and Accomplishments</h2>
Many of us plan out our days with a list of task that we need or want to accomplish, how often do you acctually finish that list? Maddy suggested using a Pomodoro timer to help stay on schedule, and unanimously we all thought it was a great idea. The five of us got together to build a to do list that could be reorganized and saved to a mongoDB database. We built an integrated timer that plays a soft one second alarm when the time has expired. We then used Passport.js so the user could sign into their own account securly with an authenticate hash parameter.

<h2 align="center">Optimizations</h2>

Optimized this to fit all screen sizes as best as possible. The goal was for the user to have a fluid experience on all their devices. Designed with mobile first in mind.
